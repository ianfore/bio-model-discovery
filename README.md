# bio-model-discovery
The aim of this project is to discover the data model of a biological study. The data model reflects the design of the study and is driven by the scientists who create the study. Many systems accommodate this by allowing users to specify the attributes/observations or data elements recorded in the study. It is often not clear which of these attributes are observations and which represent the factors/dimensions of the study.
